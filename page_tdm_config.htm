<b>Surveys 2D view</b><br>

The selected survey are displayed in plan view, with midline and station names.
Each survey has a different color. After a while the colors repeat therefore you should display
only two or three surveys at a time.<br>
Equates are shown as dashed red lines, and equated stations have a round background.<br><p>

The view can be panned and zoomed.<br>
A survey can be grabbed (tap on a station: it gets circled) and dragged around while the other surveys do not move.
In this way you can overlap stations of different surveys that you want to equate.
When they overlap circle them both by tapping the point: you can then insert the equate between them with the menu "add equate".<br><p>
