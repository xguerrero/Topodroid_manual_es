<h4>Device TROUBLESHOOTING</h4>

<!--
<b>DistoX scan</b><br>
TopoDroid may fail to find a DistoX on the first scan, and you might have to try two or three times before the DistoX is found.<br><p>

If the DistoX scan fails repeatedly, you may try a scan with the <i>Settings</i> app. If this app fails to find the DistoX, there is some problem with the bluetooth on your Android or on the DistoX,
and you will not be able to use TopoDroid with the DistoX.<br><p>
-->

<b>Device pairing</b><br>
Before TopoDroid can connect to a device, this must be paired with the Android.<br>
You can pair Android with the active DistoX through the <i>pair</i> menu or you can use the <i>Settings</i> app to pair the DistoX.<br><p>

If Android asks the DistoX PIN enter 0000 (four zeros).<br>
For the Sap5 PIN enter 000000 (six zeros).<br>
Android should not ask the Bric4 PIN.<br><p>

Once paired with the DistoX, the Android should keep the pairing, and not request the PIN again. If it keeps requesting the PIN every time you download data from the DistoX,
try using the <i>insecure</i>  socket setting.<br><p>

If you have problem connecting and downloading the data with a DistoX device try enabling the <i>Z6 workaround</i> setting.<br>
