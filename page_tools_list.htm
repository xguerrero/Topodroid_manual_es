<h4>DRAWING TOOL PICKER</h4>

This dialog is used to select the current drawing tool.<br>
It is opened with a tap on the <i>&gt;&gt;</i> button in the tools bar of <u>sketch window</u> in "drawing" mode.
<br><p>

There are three tabs at the top, <b>Point, Line, Area</b> to switch among the three types of tools.<br><p>

The dialog displays the tools of the selected type,
as a <b>list</b>, with a selection checkbox, tool icon and name.<br>

To select a tool check its box in the list, and close the dialog (Back key).  <br>
A shortcut is a double-tap on the check-box of the tool.<br><p>

The <b>Slider</b> sets tool default orientation (orientable point tools, and area tools).<br><p>

The <b>+/-</b> button changes the (global) default icon size cycling through XS, S, M, L, XL (point tools).<br><p>

When canvas views [G] are enabled and the selected tool is associated only to disabled views,
it is replaced by the corresponding "user" tool.
