<h4>TopoDroid SUBDIRECTORIES</h4>

Here is some background about how the survey data, the calibration data, and the sketches are stored.<br><p>

The app creates its default base directory in the primary public external memory, "Documents/TDX".
This directory is not removed when you uninstall the app. 
In this directory the app creates the surveys folder "TopoDroid" with the SQLite database "distox14.sqlite" that storesthe survey data, 
the surveys sketch files, and other surveys files.<br><p>

The app also creates subdirectories for the different types of files.<br>
The following subdirectories are created only in the app private directory, that is
"Android/data/com.topodroid.TDX/files" in the primary external memory.
<ul style="margin-top: 0">
<li><b>bin</b>: firmware files (DistoX2 only)</li>
<li><b>ccsv</b>: CSV text files of exported calibrations (DistoX only)</li>
<li><b>dump</b>: memory dump files (DistoX only)</li>
<li><b>symbol</b>: drawing tools files (points, lines, areas)</li>
<li>man: user manual translation</li>
</ul>
"bin" is used to store firmware files, both the factory files included in TopoDroid and the firmware dumps read from a DistoX2.<br>
The database "device10.sqlite", with the calibration data, and the devices informations is in this directory.<br><p>

<!-- A <b>zip</b> folder is created in the project folder "TDX/TopoDroid". -->
For each survey a survey-folder (named after the survey name) is created, with
the following folders:
<ul style="margin-top: 0">
<li><b>audio</b>: <i>audio</i> comments (wav files)</li>
<li><b>note</b>: survey annotations text file</li>
<li><b>photo</b>: survey pictures (jpg files)</li>
<li><b>tdr</b>: binary sketch files</li>
<li><b>out</b>: exported files</li>
</ul>
