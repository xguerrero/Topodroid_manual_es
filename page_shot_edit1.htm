It displays
<ul>
<li><b>length, azimuth, inclination</b>. Editable for manually entered shots; not editable
 for downloaded shots</li>
<li>differences of acceleration, magnetic field, and magnetic dip from the respective average values. Only for DistoX2 shots</li>
<li><b>stations</b></li>
<li><b>left arrow</b>: load previous leg</li>
<li><b>reverse</b>: swap stations</li>
<li><b>right arrow</b>: load next leg</li>
<li>shot <b>comment</b></li>
<li>profile <b>extend</b>: "left", "vertical", "right". The "extend" is "unset" if none is checked</li>
</ul><br><p>

Buttons:
<ul>
<li><img src="btn_duplicate.png" > "duplicate" flag [A]</li>
<li><img src="btn_surface.png" > "surface" flag [A]</li>
<li><img src="btn_comment.png" > "commented" flag [A]</li>
<li><img src="btn_leg_after.png" > the shot belongs to the immediately preceding leg.</li>
<li><img src="btn_leg_before.png" > the shot belongs to the immediately following leg.</li>
<li><img src="btn_backleg.png" > the shot is a backsight leg.</li>
<li><img src="btn_renumber.png" > renumber shots from this leg onward following the current station naming policy. Both stations must have been specified</li>
<li><img src="btn_splay_group.png" > apply the station change to all splays in the group of the splay shot. It applies only to the splays with same station as the edit shot.
Only FROM station must have been specified. (A group of splays is the set of splays between two legs)</li>
<li><img src="btn_plan_profile.png" > hide the splay in either the plan, or the profile view, or both (splay only) [A]</li>
<li><img src="btn_xsplay.png" > clear (or set) splay class for this splay, and possibly the previous splays [A]</li>
<li><b>OK</b>: save the changes and close the dialog</li>
<li><b>Save</b>: save the changes without closing the dialog</li>
<li><b>More</b>: switch to the secondary <a href="page_shot_edit2.htm">edit dialog</a> [A]</li>
<li><b>Cancel</b>: close the dialog without saving</li>
</ul>
<br><p>

The shot flags, "duplicate", "surface" and "commented", are mutually exclusive.
Shots with a flag do not count for the survey statistics.
The export of the shot is also affected by the shot flag, either with a flag, if the format supports it, or as comment.<br><p>

There is a warning if, upon editing a leg shot, it differs from another leg between the same stations more than one fourth in length, or 15&deg;.<br><p>

<b>Station cut-n-paste</b><br>
Station names can be 'cut', 'copied', and 'pasted' across the app, in any dialog where there is a station entry
field.<br><p>

Long-tapping the station entry field opens the drop-down menu with the three options
<ul>
<li>cut</li>
<li>copy</li>
<li>paste</li>
</ul>

<div style="font-size=90%">
<b>Splay classes</b><br>
Splay classes are enabled with a "custom setting". There are four classes:
<ul>
<li><i>normal</i>, generic, splays. Blue</li>
<li><i>x-section</i> splays. Green</li>
<li><i>horizontal</i>, plan-view, splays. Dark blue</li>
<li><i>vertical</i>, profile-view, splays. Violet</li>
</ul>

The <i>Splay class</i> button cycles through these four classes.
The splay shot is set to the chosen class, when the data are saved.
If the "all splay" button is checked, the class is set also to all previous contiguous
"normal" splays.<br><p>

Splay claases can also be set with the multiselection "special actions" button.
In multiselection you can select splays that are not contiguous and assign them all a splay class.<br><p>

If you take splays shots in a consistent way, splay classes can be set editing the leg shot and ckecking the
splay group button.
You must take first the x-section splays starting with +90 and going around in circle.
Next you take the H-splays. Finally you take the splays in the vertical plane starting again with +90.<br><p>
