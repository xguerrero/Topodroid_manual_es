<h4>STATION NAMING POLICIES</h4>

When you download data TopoDroid can automatically assign them station names. A repeated measurement is considered a leg shot, the others are splay shots.  If you stick to a convention taking measurements TopoDroid automatic station naming can be very handy. TopoDroid supports a number of conventions to automatically assign stations to shots. You can select the one that fits your habits through the settings.
<ol>
<li><b>splays+foreshot</b>. At the FROM station: you take splays first and then forward leg shots. This is the default convention.</li>
<li><b>splays+backshot</b>. At the TO station: you take splays first and then backward leg shots</li>
<li><b>backsight</b></li>
<li><b>tripod</b> [A]</li>
<li><b>magnetic anomaly</b> compensation [E]</li>
<li><b>foreshot+splays</b>. At the FROM station: you take the forward leg shots first, and then the splays</li>
<li><b>backshot+splays</b>. At the TO station: you take backward leg shots first and then splays</li>
<li><b>TopoRobot</b> [T]</li>
</ol><br><p>

Examples of the conventions (shots taken at the same station are grouped in parenthesis):
<ol>
<li> ... (1-. 1-. 1-. 1-2) (2-. 2-. 2-3) ... </li>
<li> ... (2-. 2-. 2-. 2-1) (3-. 3-. 3-2) ... </li>
<li> ... (2-1 2-. 2-. 2-3) (3-2 3-. 3-. 3-4) ... </li>
<li> ... (2-1 2-. 2-. 2-3) (4-3 4-. 4-. 4-5) ... </li>
<li> ... (2-1 2-. 2-. 2-3) (3-2 3-. 3-. 3-4) ... (same as "3")</li>
<li> ... (1-2 1-. 1-. 1-.) (2-3 2-. 2-.) ... </li>
<li> ... (2-1 2-. 2-. 2-.) (3-2 3-. 3-.) ... </li>
<li> ... (1-. 1-. 1-. 1-2) (2-. 2-. 2-3) ... (same as "1")</li>
</ol><br>

Sequence a-b-c-d for the first (foreshot) and the second (backshot) policies.<br>

<br><p>

Each time the automatic station assignment is carried out, it starts from the last leg
(or second to last for the <i>backsight</i> and <i>tripod</i> policies).
If the survey has yet no leg, it starts from the first shot. 
Therefore shots before the last leg are not modified, while stations are 
assigned to all the shots following the last leg.
This may affect the station of splays immediately following the last leg, when the station-assignment
policy is changed.<br><p>

<b>Backsight</b> policy<br>
At each station you take the backshot to the previous station, next the splay shots, and finally the forward shot to the next station.<br>
Backsight shots are checked: if a shot is not close to the opposite of the previous leg, it is not considered a backsight shot.<br>
The backsight shots are marked "duplicate".<br><p>

<b>Tripod</b> policy<br>
At station "1" you take splays and then shots to the station "2". Then you move into station "3", take shots to station "2", then splays, then shots
to station "4". Move to station "5" and so on.<br><p>

<b>Magnetic anomaly compensation</b> [Tester level]<br>
The magnetic anomaly compensation is done estimating at each station the
"local" magnetic declination by comparing the azimuths of the leg reaching to the station and the backsight leg. The azimuth of all the shots at the station are then corrected with the "local" declination. An overall declination remains because the declination at the first station cannot be determined. Furthermore the survey azimuth angles become relative as in a traverse, therefore the angle errors add up instead of compensating.<br>
The magnetic anomaly compensation requires taking basksight shots. However, with magnetic anomaly compensation the check whether a shot is a backsight does not take the azimuth into account. The magnetic anomaly compensation is carried out during the data reduction (for the sketches).<br><p>

<b>TopoRobot</b> policy<br>
The "TopoRobot" policy is just like the first, but station names follow the TopoRobot convention.<br><p>

<b>Station naming policy and activity levels</b><br>
Certain station naming policy are disabled at high activity levels:
<ul>
<li>"Tripod" requires "advanced" level</li>
<li>"Magnetic anomaly" requires "expert" level</li>
<li>"TopoRobot" requires "tester" level</li>
</ul><br>
Reducing the activity level when one of these is active, automatically set the station policy to the default policy (splays + foreshot).
The policy is automatically reinstated again if the activity level is raised to the required value or above.<br><p>

<b>Blunder leg-shot</b> [T]<br>
A <i>blunder shot</i> is an intermediate leg shot that happened to be off-target.
Typical leg sequences with blunders 'B' are "A-B-A-A" and "A-A-B-A".<br>
Blunder leg-shot detection is an experimental feature of the <i>default station naming policy</i>.
It must be enabled with a custom setting.<br>
Blunder shots are detected and marked as blank entry that will be hidden when the list is refreshed.<br>
Blunder shots can be recovered.<br><p>
