<h4>Therion STATION POINTS</h4>

<i>Therion</i> scraps must have a scale defined or at least two stations so that <i>Therion</i> can compute their scale.i<br><p>

TopoDroid has an option to automatically write into the scrap file all the stations that fall in the convex hull of the sketch. This is enabled by default, and for simple cave maps it is ok.<br><p>

However this may not be convenient if you work with xtherion and stations from other portions of the survey fall inside the scrap and there are many "spurious" station points. In this case you might want to disable this option and decide by yourself which station to add to the scrap. When the "Therion station points" option is disabled, the sketch edit dialog of stations has an option to mark the station as "Therion station point".<br><p>

Alternatively, you can let the "Therion station points" option enabled, and mark "barrier" stations to limit the automatic station points. In fact TopoDroid does not add to the Therion file stations that are beyond a "barrier" station.<br><p>
