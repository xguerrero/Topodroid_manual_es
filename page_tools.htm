<h4>DRAWING TOOLS PALETTE</h4>

The drawing tools bundled in the program include about 9 areas, 16 lines and 46 points.<br><p>

When the app starts the first time it installs the drawing tools files in the "symbol" directory. There are files for points (iconic symbols, like "entrance", or "stalagmite"), lines (like "wall", or "pit"), and areas (regions shown with a transparent color).<br><p>

New versions of the drawing tools are not automatically installed, but there is button to update them.
The coming dialog tells you the installed and the current version and asks whether to update the drawing tools.<br><p>

It is likely you do not need many of them, or maybe you need different ones. You can customize the drawing tools and the way you select them in four ways:
<ul>
<li>with the choice of drawing tool dialog</li>
<li>at the level of the sketch</li>
<li>at the level of the project (directory)</li>
<li>on the file system</li>
</ul>

<b>Drawing tool dialog</b><br>

The tools buttom bar contains only six drawing tools (for each type).
If you need another tool, you must go to the <a href="page_tools_list.htm">drawing tool dialog</a> which display the list of the 
drawing tools, subdivided under three tabs: Point, Line and Area.<br>

Each tool shows the iconic symbol, the tool name, and the tool-group if any.
<br><p>

<b>Sketch palette</b><br>

Each sketch has its own palette.  When you close the sketch it is saved with a header listing its palette. When you reopen it, the palette is set to the sketch palette. If the sketch contains items which are not in the palette they are added. If a item is not among the drawing tools it is replaced with the "user" tool. The "user" tools (point, line and area) are always in the palette.<br><p>

The sketch palette is specified through the <i>PALETTE</i> menu of the <u>sketch window</u>. This opens a dialog that lets you decide which tool enable in the sketch palette. You switch on and off the tools to your needs then close the dialog (with the <i>BACK</i> button) to save the changes. You have to do this independently for points, lines and areas.<br><p>

<b>Global palette</b><br>

Except for the "system" tools, TopoDroid loads the drawing tool from files stored in the "symbol" subdirectory of the base "TopoDroid" home. The system tools are the "user" and "label" points, "user" and "wall" lines, "user" and "water" areas. These are always enabled.<br><p>

The <i>palette</i> button of the <u>main window</u> defines the drawing tool files to load. In the coming dialog you select the tools that are loaded.  The list of files to load is saved in the project database. As for the sketch-level palette, you have to do this independently for points, lines, and areas<br><p>

When the drawing tools are updated, TopoDroid does not install the new tools, automatically.<br><p>

<b>Custom drawing tools</b><br>

At a even higher level, namely that of the base "TopoDroid" directory, you can customize the tool files.
You can modify them, delete those you do not need, and add new ones (for tools not included in the program).
Even if TopoDroid comes with many drawing tools preinstalled, it can happen that it does not contains the tools you need (or you do not like the provided ones). The tool files are plain text files, and you can write your own tool file(s). After you put them in the symbol subdirectories, TopoDroid will see and use them. The syntax of the tool files is described in a page on the website.<br><p>

The "system" drawing tools cannot be modified, nor deleted.<br><p>
