TopoDroid is an Android app for cave surveying. TopoDroid takes the raw data and helps you to organize them, and produce the line map of the survey on the spot. You can further draw sketches around the line map while you are surveying, thereby reducing the probability of error entering in your sketch, and helping you to detect errors in the data while you are still in the cave. TopoDroid has many functions to help you get the most out of your work in the cave. In this way a working map is almost ready as you are ending the survey trip.<br><p>

TopoDroid makes the time you spend surveying in the cave more effective. It is designed to handle a survey at a time. It does not manage complex cave survey projects that include a number of different surveys. This is because the purpose of TopoDroid is to help a surveyor to collect the data with more accuracy as well as to make the surveying task more pleasant, not to produce the final map of the cave. For that purpose good PC programs already exist.<br><p>

TopoDroid is specifically designed to work with the DistoX, although survey data can be manually entered.<br><p>

TopoDroid uses a fixed portrait orientation of the screen.<br><p>
