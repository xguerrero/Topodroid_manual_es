<h4>SHOT EDIT (2)</h4>

This dialog is opened from the <i>More</i> button of the first shot edit dialog.<br><p>

It shows the shot stations and data (length, azimuth, inclination).<br><p>

At an activity level "Basic" or "Normal" this dialog has only a button to <i>delete</i> the shot.<br><p>

At higher activity levels it has six or seven buttons:<p>

<ul>
<li><img src="btn_photo.png" > <a href="page_photo_dialog.htm">photo</a></li>
<li><img src="btn_audio.png" > <a href="page_audio.htm">audio</a> comment</li>
<li><img src="btn_sensor.png" > <a href="page_sensors.htm">Sensor measurements</a></li>
<li><img src="btn_shot.png" > add a shot before this (manually entering the data)</li>
<li><img src="btn_split.png" > split the survey at this shot (creating a new survey or append to another survey)</li>
<li><img src="btn_delete.png" > delete the shot</li>
<li><img src="btn_calib_check.png" > mark the shot as calibration-check</li>
</ul>
<br><p>

The <b>delete</b> button does not remove the shot from the database.
The shot gets marked as "deleted" and can be later recovered with the 
<a href="./page_undelete.htm">Recovery</a> dialog.
If the shot is the first shot of a leg you can also delete all the shots of the leg, by
checking the checkbox besides the buttons.
<br><p>

Leg shots have also a <b>calibration</b> button. This button marks the shot as "calibration-check".
These shots are not used in the survey, and their data should be taken at different roll angles.
They are recorded in the database, and are a record of the reliability of the device calibration
when the survey was done. They can be displayed with the 
<a href="./page_undelete.htm">Recovery</a> dialog.
<br><p>

<b>Survey split</b><br>
This button opens a dialog for the new survey info.
Next the survey data are assigned to the new survey, beginning with this shot.
Afterwards the program continues with the new survey.
You may need to split surveys when you have data from two (separate) survey pieces stored in the device:
these are downloaded to a single survey which must be then split accordingly.<br>

At tester level you get also the option to <b>move</b> the data to another survey.
Select the target survey from the pull-down option set, and tap the "Move" button.
<br><p>

<b>Warning</b>. It is advisable to make a zip archive before splitting/moving the 
survey and back it up to a safe place.<br><p> 

<b>At-station LRUD</b><br>
LRUD shots, at either the FROM or the TO station, are added by filling the four LRUD edit boxes
and tapping the <i>Add LRUD</i> button. <br>
It is also possible to add "intermediate" LRUD entering the distance (in the current units) along the shot,
between the LRUD point and the FROM station.<br>
For splay shots there is only the FROM station.<br>
"Intermediate" LRUD are appended to the data list, the others are added before the shot.<br>
The manual LRUD are marked as "x-splays".<br>
